# Wasserstein and Variational Image Autoencoders

Wasserstein and Variational autoencoders are two alternative ways to regularize AEs to ensure 1) better sampling properties, 2) stable training and 3) certain latent distribution.  

But which one should I choose for my use case? 

In the repository, I'm going to implement both autoencoders from scratch and compare them on various image datasets.
